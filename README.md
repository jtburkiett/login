This project-in-the-making will be a site that displays real-time data from a floating sensor at a location in Florida. 

The sensor is currently sending data via cellular network where it is then recording into a cloud database. 

Once complete, this application will be limited to admin approved access to show the data in tables updating every 5 minutes. 

The data will also be available for export as CVS, Excel or Googlesheets.
